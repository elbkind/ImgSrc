This programm allows serve dummy images. What is a dummy image.
A dummy image is used to build prototype web-pages with images included
with the right dimensions. 
To use this program first you have to build the webserver with maven

# mvn package

Than you just start the webserver with:

# java -jar target/dimage-<version>.jar <listenaddr|127.0.0.1>:<port|1147>

you could access the images with this url schema

/heightxwidth/backcolor/textcolor/text.format

_ height is a number in pixel max 2048
_ width is a number in pixel max 2048
_ height and width could be aspectsratios like 16:9
_ backcolor is a hexnumber with 1 or 3 or 6 digits and 2 or 4 or 6 digits (RGBA) channel
_ textcolor is a hexnumber with 2 or 3 or 6 digits and 2 or 4 or 6 digits (RGBA) channel
_ textcolor and backcolor in RGBA could be writen A,50 (#AAAAAA,50%)
_ text is a string if the string is to long nothing will be shown
_ format is
  * .png for PNG Images
  * .jpg for JPEG Images
  * .gif for GIF Images

it is possible not to specify all values and get all filled up with defaults.
The defaults are:
_ height,width 100px
- backcolor #444444
- textcolor #ffffff
_ text <width>x<heigth>
